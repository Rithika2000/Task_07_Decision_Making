# Task_07_Decision_Making


Purpose: Convert prior LLM narrative and analytics into actionable, risk-tiered recommendations for coaches/admins, with uncertainty, ethics, and full reproducibility documented.
Recommended Actions:
•	LOW RISK: Increase touches for Emma Ward (46 A, 76 total contributions) and monitor Olivia Adamson's development (5.33 contributions/game in limited play)
•	LOW RISK: Leverage Meghan Rode's defensive versatility (76 combined GB+CT+DC) for strategic matchups
•	MEDIUM RISK: Investigate shooting efficiency patterns for Mackenzie Rich and Bri Peters (both 100% rates, sample size unknown)
•	MEDIUM RISK: Test Emma Muchnick (34 G leader) in expanded offensive schemes given strong shots-to-goals correlation (r≈0.99)
•	HIGH RISK: Any roster or scholarship decisions require multi-metric evaluation beyond single-stat performance
Overall Uncertainty: Moderate confidence in findings due to 32-player dataset with some small-sample individual metrics and perfect percentages requiring attempt-count verification.

1) Stakeholder & Decision Context
Audience: Head Coach, Position Coaches, Performance Staff, Athletic Director.
Decision to make: What near-term tactical adjustments and medium-term experiments will most improve scoring efficiency and possession without creating unintended ethical or operational risks.
What’s at stake: Medium risk. Recommendations can affect playing time, competitive outcomes, and athlete morale; therefore, actions must be transparent, fair, and reversible.

2) Data Provenance & Scope (What we’re basing decisions on)
•	Dataset: 32 players; season counts and rates for Goals (G), Assists (A), Shots (SH), Shooting % (SH%), Shots-on-Goal % (SOG%), Ground Balls (GB), Caused Turnovers (CT), Draw Controls (DC), Fouls, and GP–GS (Games Played–Games Started).
•	Narrative base: The Task 6 one-minute “reporter stand-up” video summarized the same dataset; language was cross-checked against the “2025 Syracuse University Lacrosse Statistics” document.
•	Known limitations: No minute-by-minute usage; no opponent strength or shot location coordinates; some standout values arise from small samples (e.g., 3 GP).
•	Privacy & rights: Athletic performance figures only; any AI-generated media is explicitly labeled to prevent deception.
3. Methodology & Validation
a. Descriptive Statistics Recreation
•	Finishing: Emma Muchnick led scoring with 34 goals.
•	Creation: Emma Ward led assists with 46 and posted the top combined offensive contribution (76 G+A).
•	Per-game impact (small sample): Olivia Adamson recorded 10 G, 6 A in 3 GP (≈ 3.33 GPG and 5.33 contributions/game).
•	Accuracy leaders: Mackenzie Rich 100% SH%; Bri Peters 100% SOG%.
•	Possession/Defense: Kaci Benoit 34 GB; Meghan Rode 76 using a simple impact proxy (GB+CT+DC).
•	Teamwide trend: Shots strongly predict goals, r ≈ 0.99.
These match the Task 6 narrative and the earlier statistics review.

b. LLM Analysis Process
Write a concise “Uncertainty & Limitations” section for a stakeholder report on Syracuse Women’s Lacrosse (32-player season dataset with G, A, SH, SH%, SOG%, GB, CT, DC, Fouls, GP–GS). 
Must include:
• High confidence in shots→goals relationship (r ≈ 0.99).
• Moderate–high confidence in leaders: Emma Ward (46 A; 76 G+A), Emma Muchnick (34 G), Benoit (34 GB), Rode (GB+CT+DC = 76).
• Provisional findings where samples are small: Olivia Adamson (10 G, 6 A in 3 GP), perfect rates (Mackenzie Rich 100% SH%, Bri Peters 100% SOG%).
• Note data gaps (no minutes/opponent strength/shot location detail).
• Plain language; no new numbers; label the block: “LLM-generated analysis.”
End with one sentence on how upcoming trials/audits will increase confidence.

c. Uncertainty & Confidence
•  Aggregate relationship (shots→goals): Very high confidence; removing a few top scorers does not materially change the correlation’s strength.
•  Player-level leaders (Muchnick goals; Ward assists/total): Moderate-to-high confidence; rankings remain consistent when normalized by games played.
•  Small-sample flags: Adamson’s per-game rates are promising but provisional (3 GP).
•  Perfect rates: Rich 100% SH% and Peters 100% SOG% indicate excellence but, without attempt counts, carry wide uncertainty bands. Treat as signals to investigate, not conclusions to operationalize at scale without further data.
4. Findings & Analysis
a. Sanity Checks & Domain Validation
•  Missingness/outliers: Non-player summary lines were excluded; extreme percentages were inspected to ensure they stem from legitimate small-denominator scenarios rather than data entry errors.
•  Leakage: No outcome leakage (e.g., using post-hoc information to predict outcomes) was found.
•  Domain sense-check: Coaches should expect a strong link between volume and output—our data confirms this—but efficiency and possession wins separate good from great.
b. Bias & Fairness Considerations
•  Starter vs. non-starter bias: Where possible, we compared normalized (per-game) performance to avoid automatically favoring starters due to minutes.
•  Volume bias: High-volume shooters look great in totals; we pair volume with efficiency (e.g., SH%, SOG%, contributions per game) to avoid rewarding low-quality volume.
•  Transparency to athletes: If trials or role tweaks are run, communicate criteria up front (what will be measured; thresholds for success) to protect trust and team culture.
•  No single-metric decisions: Personnel or scholarship decisions should not hinge on a solitary stat or LLM narrative.
c. Robustness & Sensitivity
•  Remove top scorers: The shots→goals relationship remains very strong; Ward’s creation leadership and Benoit/Rode possession/defense edges persist.
•  Exclude very small GP (e.g., <5): Adamson’s per-game superiority attenuates, which is expected; hence we propose a trial rather than immediate role changes.
•  Normalize by GP: Rankings for Ward (creation), Muchnick (finishing), Benoit/Rode (possession/defense) remain stable.
d. Uncertainty & Limitations
LLM-generated analysis.
•	Overall certainty (high): Shot volume is strongly associated with goals (r ≈ 0.99). This holds under simple sensitivity checks and supports efforts to increase high-quality shot creation.
•	Leaders (moderate–high confidence): Evidence consistently supports Emma Ward as primary creator (46 A; 76 G+A) and Emma Muchnick as top finisher (34 G). Kaci Benoit (34 GB) and Meghan Rode (GB+CT+DC = 76) reliably anchor possession/disruption.
•	Small-sample caution (provisional): Olivia Adamson’s per-game impact (10 G, 6 A across 3 GP) is promising but based on limited exposure; treat as a hypothesis to validate, not a guaranteed effect.
•	Perfect-rate caveats (provisional): Mackenzie Rich (100% SH%) and Bri Peters (100% SOG%) likely reflect few attempts; interpret carefully until sample sizes grow.
•	Data gaps: Missing minutes played, opponent strength, and shot-location context limit deeper causal claims and fine-grained role optimization.
•	Path to higher confidence: Use controlled minutes trials and shot-selection/keeper-adjusted audits to gather prospective evidence and confirm or refine these conclusions.


5. Tiered Recommendations
A. Operational — Low Risk (implement immediately)
•  Ward-centric creation packages
•	Action: Install 2–3 quick-hitter set plays each half with Ward as the primary distributor (e.g., wing sweep → slip cut; X-feed to crease).
•	Rationale: Ward’s sustained assist volume and total contribution justify structured chances that leverage her vision.
•	Ethics: No disadvantage to individuals; transparent tactical tweak.
•  Muchnick in high-yield finishing zones
•	Action: Increase her touches in the spots where she historically converts best; add one late-clock option paired with Ward.
•	Rationale: A proven finisher benefits most when fed in preferred lanes/angles.
•	Ethics: Role clarity; performance-based.
B. Investigatory — Medium Risk (test, measure, decide)
5.	Controlled minutes trial for Adamson
o	Action: Two-game scripted shifts; preannounce evaluation criteria; no immediate demotion of others.
o	Rationale: Per-game outputs are elite but from 3 GP—trial confirms or revises the signal.
o	Decision rule (example): Maintain or expand role only if the trial sustains strong contributions per game and reasonable turnover control.
6.	Shot-selection audit (video + situational context)
o	Action: Review shot origin, pressure, and keeper quality; confirm whether high SH% stems from superior selection vs. soft opposition.
o	Rationale: Prevent overfitting to inflated efficiency.
C. High-Stakes — Requires Human/HR/Legal Review
8.	Major role changes or contract/scholarship decisions
o	Action: Any decision with lasting consequences requires a multi-factor review (coach panel, performance staff, compliance).
o	Rationale: Avoid over-reliance on a dataset snapshot or LLM narrative; protect athlete welfare and institutional integrity.
7. Ethical & Legal Considerations (Explicit)
•	Transparency: All AI-generated text/video used for communication is clearly labeled; decision memos separate AI narrative from human-verified analysis.
•	Player dignity & fairness: Trials use pre-declared, performance-relevant criteria; feedback is shared constructively; athletes may ask questions about the metrics used.
•	Privacy & IP: Only public athletic performance data is used; no academic/medical records; stock or licensed visuals only.
•	Non-maleficence: No recommendation is intended to punish; the focus is on team improvement and individual development.
8. Next Steps & Validation Plan
1.	This week: Implement low-risk operational changes (Ward sets, Muchnick zones, GB/CT drill blocks); brief the team on purpose and metrics.
2.	Next 2 games: Run Adamson’s controlled minutes trial with pre-announced evaluation criteria; begin the shot-selection audit.
3.	After 2–3 games: Review trial results and audit findings; decide on any incremental role changes; communicate rationale to the team.
4.	Ongoing: Keep a simple change log (what we tried, what happened, what we kept). Update coaches/AD with short summaries and ensure AI media remains properly labeled.
